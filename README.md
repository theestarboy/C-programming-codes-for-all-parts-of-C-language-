# 1st Year C Programming Projects

This repository contains various C programs I wrote during my first year. I created these to practice and understand core programming concepts like loops (`for`, `while`), conditional statements (`if-else`), and functions by applying them to real-world scenarios.

## Projects Included

### Finance & Banking
* **`program for calculating simple interest.c`** - A basic program to calculate simple interest based on principal, rate, and time.
* **`program for calculating compound interest.c`** - Calculates compound interest (good practice for using the `<math.h>` library).
* **`program for calculating loan qualification.c`** - Uses conditional logic to check if an applicant meets specific criteria to qualify for a loan.

### Utility & Billing Systems
* **`program for calculating electricity bill.c`** - A straightforward billing program that calculates charges based on different tiers of power consumption.
* **`electricity bill calculator with functions.c`** - An upgraded version of the electricity bill calculator, rewritten using user-defined functions for cleaner code.
* **`program for calculating fine for library books.c`** - Calculates library fines based on how many days a borrowed book is overdue.

### Loops & Fun
* **`While program for happy new year countdown.c`** - A simple program that uses a `while` loop to simulate a countdown timer to the New Year.
* **`For loop program for calculating the multiplication table of four.c`** - Uses a `for` loop to generate and print a math multiplication table.

## How to Compile and Run (Windows)

To run any of these programs, you need a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your computer. 

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the files, and run the following commands.

**1. Compile the program:**
(Since the file names have spaces, make sure to include the quotation marks!)
```cmd
gcc "program for calculating electricity bill.c" -o electricity_bill
